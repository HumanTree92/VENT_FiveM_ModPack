# How to install
The installation is rather quite simple.

1. Download the .zip or clone the repository to your desktop.
2. Extract the .zip to your desktop.
3. Go to your FiveM Application Data Folder (FiveM Directory)
4. Drag & Drop all the contents inside the Drag & Drop into your FiveM Directory

# Radiance Settings
Pick whatever Radiance Setting you want to use. You can use whatever one you want & it doesn't have to be one of these.
Install Path: citizen/common/data

Differences: 
- Radiance V 1.8 (Bright Lights but makes interior light bright)
- Realistic Radiance 1.0.1 (Bright Lights but decreases interior light to default & make Police lights themselves look weird)

That's it. It's all installed
